Host:    compute-0-30.local (AVX, 62 GB RAM)
Command: /iqtree-2.3.6-Linux-intel/bin/iqtree2 -s results/alignment/combined_hsp70_aligned.fa -m LG -bb 1000 -pre results/tree/hsp70_tree
Seed:    299935 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Tue Dec  3 18:32:20 2024
Kernel:  AVX - 1 threads (10 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 10 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
